,Y3VidXJ0X2Fjbl9iZWdpbm5lcg==,,"Please provide the document containing the financial data.  I need the text of the document (or a link to it if it's online) to extract, analyze, and summarize the financial information as requested.  I cannot process the information without the actual data. Once you provide the data, I will:

1. **Extract the tables:**  I will identify and extract any tables present in the document, preserving the structure (rows, columns, headers).
2. **Identify key metrics:** I will locate and identify key financial metrics like Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Profit, Operating Expenses, Operating Income, Net Income (Net Profit), Assets, Liabilities, and Equity.
3. **Analyze trends:** I will analyze the data across different time periods (e.g., years, quarters) to identify trends and patterns in revenue, expenses, and profitability.
4. **Highlight anomalies:** I will point out any significant and unusual changes or outliers in the data, such as sudden increases or decreases in revenue or expenses.
5. **Provide JSON output:**  I will present the extracted tabular data in a well-formatted JSON structure for easy further processing and analysis.


Example of the expected JSON output (this is just a sample, the actual format will depend on your document's data):

```json
{
  ""incomeStatement"": {
    ""year"": [
      {""year"": 2022, ""revenue"": 1000000, ""expenses"": 600000, ""netProfit"": 400000},
      {""year"": 2023, ""revenue"": 1200000, ""expenses"": 700000, ""netProfit"": 500000}
    ]
  },
  ""balanceSheet"": {
    ""year"": [
      {""year"": 2022, ""assets"": 1500000, ""liabilities"": 500000, ""equity"": 1000000},
      {""year"": 2023, ""assets"": 1800000, ""liabilities"": 600000, ""equity"": 1200000}
    ]
  }
}
